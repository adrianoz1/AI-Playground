# embedding example

To run this test, you need to install the dependency packages using npm i or yarn. Then, change the content of the text you want to embed in the index.js file, and finally execute the file using node index.js.

To install the dependencies using npm, simply type the following command in the terminal:

```npm install```
If you prefer to use Yarn, type the following command instead:

```yarn```

After installing the dependencies, open the index.js file and change the content of the text you want to embed. After making the necessary changes, save the file.
Finally, to run the file, type the following command in the terminal:

```node index.js```

This will start the test, and you will be able to see the result of the embedded text.
